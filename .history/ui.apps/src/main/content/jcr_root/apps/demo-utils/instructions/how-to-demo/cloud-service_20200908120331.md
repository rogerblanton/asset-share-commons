## FAQs

### What's the difference between "AEM as a Cloud Service" and "Skyline"?

Nothing. Skyline was the **ADOBE INTERNAL** code name for the AEM as a Cloud Service product.

Never use the term "Skyline" (especially outside of Adobe), instead use "Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service".

To review how demo applications can be installed, please review this [deployment overview video](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/deploying/overview.html#Introduction) that uses the WKND site as the "example AEM application" to deploy.
