All Demos consolidates a variety of common demo sites, assets and tools into a single AEM Project that can be deployed to AEM as a Cloud Service via Cloud Manager.
All demos can also be deployed to the local Quickstart Jar using it's **all** package, via Package Manger.

It is important to remember that **any** code deployed to AEM as a Cloud Service **must** originate in an AEM Project that is committed to Git, and pushed into Adobe Cloud Manager for deployment. No code (ie. nothing in `/apps`) can be deployed to AEM as a Cloud Service via Package Manager.

## What's in All Demos?

All Demos includes:

+ Demo Utils for AEM as a Cloud Service
+ WKND Site
+ WKND Assets
+ WKND App (SPA Editor)
+ WKND Mobile (AEM Headless)
+ Core Components Showcase
+ Asset Share Commons

The high-level overview of deploying All Demos to AEM as a Cloud Service.

1. Git **clone** the [All Demos Git Repository](https://git.corp.adobe.com/aem-technical-marketing/com.adobe.aem.demos.all-demos) to your local machine. (Requires Adobe network access)
    ```
    $ git clone https://git.corp.adobe.com/aem-technical-marketing/com.adobe.aem.demos.all-demos
    ```
2. **Add the Adobe Cloud Manager Git repository** as an upstream repository
    ```
    $ cd com.adobe.aem.demos.all-demos

    $ git remote add adobe <Cloud Manager Git Url>

    $ git remote -v
    ```
3. Git **push** the All Demos code base to a branch in the newly added upstream repository
    ```
    $ git push adobe master:all-demos 
    ```
4. Configure an Adobe Cloud Manager deployment pipeline to deploy the branch containing All Demos code
