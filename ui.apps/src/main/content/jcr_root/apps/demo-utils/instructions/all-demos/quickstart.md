All Demos consolidates a variety of common demo sites, assets and tools into a single AEM Project that can be deployed to AEM as a Cloud Service via Cloud Manager.
All Demos can also be deployed to the local Quickstart Jar using it's **all** package, via Package Manger.

It is important to remember that **any** code deployed to AEM as a Cloud Service **must** originate in an AEM Project that is committed to Git, and pushed into Adobe Cloud Manager for deployment. No code (ie. nothing in `/apps`) can be deployed to AEM as a Cloud Service via Package Manager.

## What's in All Demos?

All Demos includes:

+ Demo Utils for AEM as a Cloud Service
