## Ensure AEM is started in Dynamic Media (DMS7) mode

1. Rename the quickstart jar to **cq-author-dynamicmedia_scene7-p4502.jar** and re/start AEM.
    * Or, alternatively, start from the command line with the run-modes flag: `java -jar cq-author-p4502.jar -r author,dynamicmedia_scene7`.
2. Verify that AEM started with the `dynamicmedia_scene7` run-mode by checking [Tools > Operations > System Overview](/libs/granite/operations/content/systemoverview.html).

### Manual set up special instructions

* **Publish Assets: Upon Activation**
    * During manual set up, if `Publish Assets: Upon Activation` is selected, you **must** wait 15 mins for the supporting assets to be published to and processed by Scene 7.
    * After waiting 15 mins, you must Publish any Image and Viewer presets at:
        * <a href="/mnt/overlay/dam/gui/content/s7dam/viewerpresets/viewerpresets.html" target="_blank">AEM > Tools > Assets > Viewer Presets</a>
        * <a href="/mnt/overlay/dam/gui/content/s7dam/imagepresets/imagepresets.html" target="_blank">AEM > Tools > Assets > Image Presets</a>
