### Manual Set up Special instructions

* **Publish Assets: Upon Activation**
    * During manual set up, if `Publish Assets: Upon Activation` is selected, you **must** wait 15 mins for the supporting assets to be published to and processed by Scene 7.
    * After waiting 15 mins, you must Publish any Image and Viewer presets at:
        * <a href="/mnt/overlay/dam/gui/content/s7dam/viewerpresets/viewerpresets.html" target="_blank">AEM > Tools > Assets > Viewer Presets</a>
        * <a href="/mnt/overlay/dam/gui/content/s7dam/imagepresets/imagepresets.html" target="_blank">AEM > Tools > Assets > Image Presets</a>
* Allow all Presets to publish before using. When `Publish Assets` is set to `Immediately`, they will automatically queue up to publish.
