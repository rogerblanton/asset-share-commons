## FAQs

### What's the difference between "AEM as a Cloud Service" and "Skyline"?

Nothing. Skyline was the **ADOBE INTERNAL** code name for the AEM as a Cloud Service product.

Never use the term "Skyline" (especially outside of Adobe), instead use "Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service".

### How do I install demos on my AEM as a Cloud Service sandbox environment?

AEM as a Cloud Service (running in the Adobe Cloud) can only have Code deployed to it via Adobe Cloud Manager, which requires knowledge of AEM Maven Projects and Git.

To review how demo applications can be installed, please review this [deployment overview video](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/deploying/overview.html#Introduction) that uses the WKND site as the "example AEM application" to deploy.

### How do I run AEM as a Cloud Service locally?

Download and run the AEM as a Cloud Service Quickstart Jar:

1. In a browser, navigate to [https://downloads.experiencecloud.adobe.com](https://downloads.experiencecloud.adobe.com/content/software-distribution/en/aemcloud.html) and login with your Adobe ID.
2. Navigate to the AEM as a Cloud Service tab and download the latest AEM SDK zip file.
    + If the AEM as a Cloud Service tab is not present, your Adobe ID account is  not part of an Adobe IMS Organization that has access to the AEM as a Cloud Service product.
3. Unzip the `aem-sdk-xxx.zip`
4. Rename the Jar file to `aem-author-p4502.jar` or `aem-publish-p4503.jar`, ensure your `properties.license` file is in the same folder, and double-click the Jar to start it.
