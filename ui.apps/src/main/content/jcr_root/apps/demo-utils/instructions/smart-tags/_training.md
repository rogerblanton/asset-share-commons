### Reset Smart Tagging and Training

Smart Tagging is now isolated to your specific AEM instance (not shared across demo-ers). Smart Tags for the AEM instance can be reset in the following ways:

* **Reset Tagging Status:** Once an asset is smart tagged, it cannot not be smart tagged again for 24 hours. Resetting the **tagging status** allows the asset to be smart tagged immediately.
* **Reset Training Status:** Once an asset has been trained for smart tagging, it cannot trained again for 24 hours. Resetting the **training status** allows the asset to be re-trained immediately.
* **Full Reset of Training & Tagging:** Prior trainings are stored in the Adobe Cloud for this AEM instance. To reset all training, a full reset of Smart Tag training is required. This also resets the **training status** and **tagging status** for assets.
    * Smart Tags must be set up, otherwise clicking this button will result in an error.

## Troubleshooting Smart Tags Training

1. Verify the Smart Tags configs are correct via the <strong><a x-cq-linkchecker="skip" target="_blank" href="/system/console/jmx/com.day.cq.dam.similaritysearch.internal.impl%3Atype%3Dsimilaritysearch">Similarity Search JMX console</a> > validateConfigs() > Invoke</strong>. Ensure all response entries are successful.
1. The first time training is run for a tenant, it **MUST** be on two sets of images each with their OWN distinct tags. If that's not how the first training was executed, reset the tenant (using the buttons above) and re-train using this approach.
1. Create a new **[Smart Tags Training report](/mnt/overlay/dam/gui/content/reports/reportlist.html) > Create**. If the training report is empty for the trained tags, re-run the report every 5 minutes until there is report data for the applied tags.
