## Installation instructions

Because WKND Assets contains code, it must be deployed via [Cloud Manager](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com) to AEM as a Cloud Service.

This can be achieved in 2 primary ways:

+ Installing only the WKND Assets project, using the usual method of pushing a clone of the WKND Assets project to your Cloud Manager Git repository and building it to your AEM as a Cloud Service environment.
    + [https://git.corp.adobe.com/DemoTeam/aem-guides-wknd-assets](https://git.corp.adobe.com/DemoTeam/aem-guides-wknd-assets)
        + Requires Adobe VPN
        + Contains Demo Utils and AEM WCM Core Components

+ Installing the [All Demos](/apps/demo-utils/instructions/all-demos.html) project which contains WKND Assets, along with a variety of other demo properties.
