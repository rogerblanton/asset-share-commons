__Introducing the WKND Styler__ – an AEM Cloud Services modified WKND source which allows you to quickly and easily update CSS variables (colors, text) on AEM Cloud Services LocalHost instances.  This source is intended to give you the ability to update general branding of the WKND source via the Page Properties, instead of changing these variables directly in CRXDE.  Once you’ve honed the look and feel of your source, you can Export the CSS for sharing and use on other WKND sources.
